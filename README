Relax and Recover
=================

Relax and Recover (abbreviated Rear) is a highly modular disaster recovery
framework for GNU/Linux based systems, but can be easily extended to other
UNIX alike systems. The disaster recovery information (and maybe the backups)
can be stored via the network, local on hard disks or USB devices, DVD/CD-R,
tape, etc. The result is also a bootable image that is capable of booting via
PXE, DVD/CD, USB or tape (OBDR).

The backup can be integrated with any existing backup software so that
Rear utilizes the backup software to restore the files and provides the "glue"
surrounding the simple file restore to having a full bare metal disaster
recovery solution. Support for specific backup software has to be added to
Rear on an individual base and is very simple (look at the existing
implementations for further information).

Rear is rapidly developing, please contact the Rear developers if something is
missing.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
Rear is written entirely in bash and does not require any external programs.
However, the rescue system that is created by Rear requires some programs that
are needed to make our rescue system work:

 - mingetty
 - sfdisk

All other required programs (like sort, dd, grep, etc.) are so common, that we
don't list them as a requirement.


INSTALLATION
------------
On RPM based systems you should use the Rear RPM. Either obtain it from the
Rear homepage or build it yourself from the TAR archive with

   rpmbuild -ta rear-<version>.tar.gz

This will create an RPM for your distribution. The RPM is not platform-
dependant and should work also on other RPM based distributions.

On DEB based systems you should be able to install the RPM with alien.
Otherwise use the manual installation (see below) or, even better, contribute
the DEB package to the project.

To install Rear manually, simply copy the etc and usr directories in the source
distribution to the '/' of your system.


CONFIGURATION
-------------
To configure Rear you have to edit the configuration files in '/etc/rear/'. All
'*.conf' files there are part of the configuration, but only 'site.conf' and
'local.conf' are intended for the user configuration. All other configuration
files hold defaults for various distributions and should not be changed.

In '/etc/rear/templates/' there are also some template files which are use by
Rear to create configuration files (mostly for the boot environment). You can
use these templates to prepend your own configurations to the configuration
files created by Rear, for example you can edit 'PXE_pxelinux.cfg' to add some
general pxelinux configuration you use (I put there stuff to install Linux
over the network).

In almost all circumstances you have to configure two main settings and their
parameters: The +BACKUP+ method and the +OUTPUT+ method.

The backup method defines, how your data was saved and wether Rear should
backup your data as part of the mkrescue process or wether you use an external
application, e.g. backup software to archive your data.

The output method defines how the rescue system is written to disk and how you
plan to boot the failed computer from the rescue system.

See '/usr/share/rear/conf/default.conf' for an overview of the possible methods
and their options. An example to use TSM for backup and PXE for output and
would be to add these lines to '/etc/rear/local.conf':

----
BACKUP=TSM
OUTPUT=PXE
----

And since all your computers use NTP for time synchronisation, you should also
add these lines to '/etc/rear/site.conf':

----
TIMESYNC=NTP
----

Don't forget to distribute the 'site.conf' to all your systems.

The resulting PXE files (kernel, initrd and pxelinux configuration) will be
written to files in '/var/lib/rear/output/'. You can now modify the behaviour
by copying the appropriate configuration variables from 'default.conf' to
'local.conf' and changing them to suit your environment.


USAGE
-----
To use Rear you always call the main script '/usr/sbin/rear':

----
# rear help
Usage: rear [-d] [-D] [-r KERNEL] [-s] [-S] [-v] [-V] COMMAND [ARGS...]

Available options:
 -d           debug mode; log debug messages
 -D           debugscript mode; log every function call
 -r KERNEL    kernel version to use; current: '2.6.32-131.2.1.el6.x86_64'
 -s           simulation mode; show what scripts rear would include
 -S           step-by-step mode; acknowledge each script individually
 -v           verbose mode; show more output
 -V           version information

List of commands:
 checklayout     check if the disk layout has changed
 dump            dump configuration and system information
 format          format and label media for use with rear
 mkbackup        create rescue media and backup system
 mkbackuponly    backup system without creating rescue media
 mkrescue        create rescue media only
 recover         recover the system; only valid during rescue
 validate        submit validation information

Use 'rear -v help' for more advanced commands.
----

To view/verify your configuration, run +rear dump+. It will print out the
current settings for +BACKUP+ and +OUTPUT+ methods and some system information.

To create a new rescue environment, simply call +rear mkrescue+. Do not forget
to copy the resulting rescue system away so that you can use it in the case of
a system failure. Use +rear mkbackup+ instead if you are using the builtin
backup functions (like +BACKUP=NETFS+)

To recover your system, start the computer from the rescue system and run
+rear recover+. Your system will be recovered and you can restart it and
continue to use it normally.
