// FIXME: Make this part more generic and add distribution information

= Getting started

== Software requirements
Relax-and-Recover can be installed from a native RPM package. Since it is
mostly a collection of Bash scripts, there is no need to make RPM packages
for each Red Hat release. For the supported RHEL distributions it is mostly
version-agnostic.

Relax-and-Recover has few dependencies:

 - recent syslinux (tested with 4.0)

For OBDR tape mode you need the following packages:

 - lsscsi
 - mkisofs
 - sg3_utils

Relax-and-Recover at this time has only been tested on RHEL4, RHEL5 and RHEL6.


== Limitations
Relax-and-Recover offers a lot of flexibility in various use-cases, however it
does have some limitations under certain circumstances:

 - Relax-and-Recover depends on the software of the running system. When
   recovering this system to newer hardware, it is possible that the hardware
   support of the original system does not support the newer hardware.
+
This problem has been seen when restoring an older RHEL4 with an older HP
Proliant Support Pack (PSP) to more recent hardware. This PSP did not detect
the newer HP SmartArray controller or its firmware.

 - Relax-and-Recover supports recovering to different hardware, but it cannot
   always automatically adapt to this new environment. In such cases it
   requires a manual intervention to eg.

   * modify the _disklayout.conf_ to indicate the number of controller, disks
     or specific custom desires during restore

   * reduce the partition-sizes/LV-sizes when restoring to smaller storage

   * pull network-media or configure the network interfaces manually

 - Depending on your back-up strategy you may have to perform actions, like:

   * insert the required tape(s)

   * perform commands to restore the backup


== Installation
