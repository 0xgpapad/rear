* finalize/Fedora/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh
	- needs to be written, seems like RH builds rich initramfs with all modules included
	- be aware, recent Fedora uses dracut instead of mkinitrd

* finalize/Gentoo/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh
	- needs to be written, I have no idea what should be done here (since I don't have Gentoo)

* write network migration code for all other distributions
	- some work has been done in the meantime, but not sure if it is sufficient enough to cover all
	- waiting on customer feedback

* support dhcp for network migration
	- has been added in 1.9.0
	- waiting on customer feedback

* prep/Linux-ia64/20_getty_or_agetty.sh might be obsolete after the USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE piece has been added and tested successfully
	- ia64 architecture will not support Linux anymore in future? Dropped off the list in RHEL6.

* Can we drop the mkvendorrpm workflow?
