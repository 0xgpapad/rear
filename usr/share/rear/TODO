= Relax and Recovery TODO

A list of items that wait for someone to volunteer to fix :)


== Known issues
* We have seen boot-problems where udev seems to wait indefinitely
  - since no USB support has been loaded, USB keyboards are not working
    to intervene
  - cold-booting this hardware always caused udev to continue (!)


== Clean up
* Unify the extlinux|isolinux configuration code between ISO and USB.
  - ATM this is a copy-paste job
  - probably put the meat into a function or a symlinked script

* _33_find_isolinux.sh_
  - currently used also to determine the +SYSLINUX_DIR+
  - also for +OUTPUT=USB+
  - finding +SYSLINUX_DIR+ should be a script of its own
