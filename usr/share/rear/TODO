Relax and Recovery TODO
=======================

A list of items that wait for someone to volunteer to fix :)

* reboot on Ubuntu rescue media broken
	- Probably we miss some script or config for upstart

* 33_find_isolinux.sh
	- currently used also to determine the SYSLINUX_DIR
	- also for OUTPUT=USB
	- finding SYSLINUX_DIR should be a script of its own

* unify the extlinux|isolinux configuration code between ISO and USB. 
	- ATM this is a copy-paste job
	- probably put the meat into a function or a symlinked script

* finalize/Fedora/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh
	- needs to be written, seems like RH builds rich initramfs with all modules included
	- be aware, recent Fedora uses dracut instead of mkinitrd

* finalize/Gentoo/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh
	- needs to be written, I have no idea what should be done here (since I don't have Gentoo)

* write network migration code for all other distributions
	- some work has been done in the meantime, but not sure if it is sufficient enough to cover all
	- waiting on customer feedback

* support dhcp for network migration
	- has been added in 1.9.0
	- waiting on customer feedback

* prep/Linux-ia64/20_getty_or_agetty.sh might be obsolete after the USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE piece has been added and tested successfully
	- ia64 architecture will not support Linux anymore in future? Dropped off the list in RHEL6.

* Can we drop the mkvendorrpm workflow?
  - merge the default SPEC file with the Fedora specific SPEC file

* Support dhcpcd (SLES11) in addition to dhclient

* make sure that the new NETFS_PREFIX stuff does not brake existing setups, e.g. by putting the backup in a different location
  - leave the default as it was before $(uname -n) to support existing setups
  - make the code robust enought to handle all kind of static and dynamic NETFS_PREFIX scenarios, regardless of how the path looks
  - write documentation how users can enable advanced stuff through setting a smarter NETFS_PREFIX, provide examples

* avoid disabling selinux during backup
  - add --selinux option to tar and testing
  - rsync -X option tests required
