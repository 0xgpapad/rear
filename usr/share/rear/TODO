* finalize/Fedora/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh
- needs to be written, seems like RH builds rich initramfs with all modules included
- be aware, recent Fedora uses dracut instead of mkinitrd

* finalize/Gentoo/i386/17_rebuild_initramfs.sh
- needs to be written, I have no idea what should be done here (since I don't have Gentoo)

* write network migration code for all other distributions

* support dhcp for network migration

* prep/Linux-ia64/20_getty_or_agetty.sh might be obsolete after the USE_SERIAL_CONSOLE piece has been added and tested successfully
