How to recover your system:
---------------------------

To recover your system, copy the attached raw disk image onto a disk device (a USB stick will do).
Do not use a partition (like /dev/sdc1), use the complete disk device (like /dev/sdc).
Be careful, this will overwrite disk contents.

Example:

   dd if=<image> bs=1M of=<device>

Then boot from the disk device into the rescue system.



How to install a TCG Opal pre-boot authentication (PBA) image
-------------------------------------------------------------


a) To enable TCG Opal support and install the PBA image onto a disk device:

      sudo rear installopalpba --setup [<image>] <device>


b) To replace the PBA image on a disk device where TCG Opal support has been enabled:

      sudo rear installopalpba [<image>] <device>


Note: If the <image> parameter is not provided, ReaR will either
- use the provided image when called on a rescue system, or
- generate a new image.
