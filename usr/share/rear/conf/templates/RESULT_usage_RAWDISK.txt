How to recover your system:
---------------------------

To recover your system, copy the attached raw disk image file onto a disk device (a USB stick will do).
Always use the complete disk device (like /dev/sdc) instead of just a disk partition (like /dev/sdc1).
Be careful to select the right device, this will overwrite disk contents.

Example:

   dd if=IMAGE_FILE bs=1M of=DISK_DEVICE

Then boot from the disk device into the rescue system.
