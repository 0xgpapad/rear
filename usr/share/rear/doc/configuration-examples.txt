Configuration examples for /etc/rear/{local|site}.conf files:
------------------------------------------------------------
There are 2 very important variables to define, OUTPUT and BACKUP. The OUTPUT variable defines
where the rescue image should be send to. The BACKUP setting defines our backup/restore strategy.
Possible OUTPUT setting are:
	- OUTPUT=ISO	: creates a bootable ISO9660 image on disk as rear-$(hostname).iso
	- OUTPUT=PXE	: creates on a remote PXE/NFS server the required files (such as
			  configuration file, kernel and initrd image
	- OUTPUT=TSM	: use IBM Tivoli Storage Manager programs
	- OUTPUT=DP	: use HP DataProtector programs
	- OUTPUT=NBU	: use Symantec NetBackup programs
	- OUTPUT=BACULA	: use Bacula programs
	- OUTPUT=OBDR	: create a bootable OBDR tape including the backup archive

* To backup to a local disk, NFS, CIFS or USB disk and gave an ISO image created one can define:
OUTPUT=ISO
BACKUP=NETFS
and the NETFS_URL setting depends on the type of disk:
	- local disk:	NETFS_URL=file:///directory/path/
	- NFS disk:	NETFS_URL=nfs://nfs-server-name/directort/path
	- CIFS disk:	NETFS_URL=cifs://cifs-server-name/directort/path
			NETFS_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/.cifs"
			is handy to pass along the:
				username=<username>
				password=<secret password>
				domain=<domain>
NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=y (if you want to keep the previous backup archive)


The One Button Disaster Recovery (OBDR) process is a bit special:
# rear mkobdr
is required to use the correct work-flow (an ISO image has to be made before
writing it on tape) and the following variables need to be defined:

For example, if you want an OBDR image on tape, and use GNU tar
for recovery, you would use:
OUTPUT=OBDR
BACKUP=NETFS
NETFS_URL=tape:///dev/nst0

The usage of bextract command (of Bacula) is still under discussion how to
implement this, so it can/will change:
OUTPUT=OBDR
ISO_URL=obdr:///dev/nst0
BACKUP=BEXTRACT
