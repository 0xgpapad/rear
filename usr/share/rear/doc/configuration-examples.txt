Configuration examples for /etc/rear/{local|site}.conf files:
------------------------------------------------------------
There are 2 very important variables to define, OUTPUT and BACKUP. The OUTPUT variable defines
where the rescue image should be send to. The BACKUP setting defines our backup/restore strategy.

Possible OUTPUT setting are:
	- OUTPUT=ISO	: creates a bootable ISO9660 image on disk as rear-$(hostname).iso
	- OUTPUT=PXE	: creates on a remote PXE/NFS server the required files (such as
			  configuration file, kernel and initrd image
	- OUTPUT=OBDR	: create a bootable OBDR tape including the backup archive
	- OUTPUT=USB	: create a bootable USB disk (with syslinux or extlinux)

Possible BACKUP settings are:
	- BACKUP=TSM	: use IBM Tivoli Storage Manager programs
	- BACKUP=DP	: use HP DataProtector programs
	- BACKUP=NBU	: use Symantec NetBackup programs
	- BACKUP=BACULA	: use Bacula programs
	- BACKUP=NETFS	: use ReaR internal backup with tar (or similar)
	- BACKUP=REQUEST_RESTORE : no backup, just ask user to somehow restore the filesystems
	- BACKUP=EXTERNAL : provide custom backup and restore commands

Common Scenarios
================

Backup with 3rd party software, ReaR used for bare-metal disaster recovery
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Set BACKUP to the software you are using and OUTPUT to your preferred boot method. In most cases
only these two settings are required

Backup with ReaR, ReaR used for bare-metal disaster recovery
------------------------------------------------------------

Set BACKUP=NETFS and OUTPUT to your preferred boot method. You must provide the backup
target location through the NETFS_URL variable:
	- local disk:	NETFS_URL=file:///directory/path/
	- NFS disk:	NETFS_URL=nfs://nfs-server-name/share/path
	- TAPE drive:	NETFS_URL=tape:///dev/nst0
	- CIFS disk:	NETFS_URL=cifs://cifs-server-name/share/path
			To provide credentials for CIFS mounting use a credentials file:
			NETFS_OPTIONS="cred=/etc/rear/.cifs"
			is handy to pass along the:
				username=<username>
				password=<secret password>
				domain=<domain>
	- USB disk:	NETFS_URL=usb:///dev/sdb1  (whatever device your USB disk has)
			(together with OUTPUT=USB everything is on an USB device)

NETFS_KEEP_OLD_BACKUP_COPY=y (if you want to keep the previous backup archive)

Notes about USB disk
- - - - - - - - - -

With USB disk we refer to all kinds of external storage, like USB keys or disks, eSATA disks, 
ZIP disks etc. So far the best approach seems to be to
* create a partition on the device
* format it with ext3 or ext4

Special handling for bootable tape drives (OBDR)
------------------------------------------------

For example, if you want an OBDR image on tape, and use GNU tar
for recovery, you would use:
BACKUP=NETFS
OUTPUT=OBDR
NETFS_URL=tape:///dev/nst0

Special handling for bootable tape drives (OBDR) and bare-metal recovery of Bacula server
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The usage of bextract command (of Bacula) is also implemented to restore
a Bacula archive (without a bacula server being active):
BACKUP=BEXTRACT
OUTPUT=OBDR
ISO_URL=obdr:///dev/nst0
