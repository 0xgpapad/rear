== NAME
rear - bare metal disaster recovery tool


== SYNOPSIS
*rear* [*-d*] [*-D*] [*-r* _KERNEL_] [*-s*] [*-S*] [*-v*] [*-V*] _COMMAND_ [_ARGS_...]


== DESCRIPTION
Relax and Recover (abbreviated *ReaR*) is a highly modular disaster recovery
framework for GNU/Linux based systems, but can be easily extended to other
UNIX alike systems. The disaster recovery information can be stored and used
via the network, local on hard disks or USB devices, DVD/CD-R. The result is
also a bootable image that is capable of booting via PXE, DVD/CD. 

The disaster recovery can be integrated with any existing backup software
so that ReaR utilizes the backup software to restore the files and provides
the "glue" surrounding the simple file restore to having a full bare metal
disaster recovery solution. Support for specific backup software has to be
added to rear on an individual base and is very simple (look at an existing
implementation for further information).

== BACKGROUND INFORMATION
The process of bare metal disaster recovery consists of two parts:

 - Recreate the system layout
 - Restore the data to the system

Most backup software solutions are very good at restoring data but do not
support recreating the system layout. Relax and Recover is very good at
recreating the system layout but and works best when used together with
a supported backup software.

In this combination ReaR recreates the system layout and calls the backup
software to restore the actual data. Thus there is no unnessecary duplicate
data storage and the ReaR rescue media can be very small.

For demonstration and special use purposes ReaR also includes an internal
backup method, NETFS, which can be used to create a simple tar.gz archive
of the system. For all permanent setups we recommend using something more
professional for backup, either a traditional backup software (open
source or commercial) or rsync with hardlink based solutions, e.g. RSYNC
BACKUP MADE EASY.

== BACKUP SOFTWARE INTEGRATION
Currently ReaR supports the following backup methods. Please distinguish
carefully between ReaR support for 3rd party backup software and ReaR
internal backup methods. The latter also creates a backup of your data
while the former will only integrate ReaR with the backup software to
restore the data with the help of the backup software without actually
creating backups. This means that for all non-internal backup software
you *must* take care of creating backups yourself.

Especially the +rear mkbackup+ command can be confusing as it is only
useful for the internal backup methods and has no function at all with
the other backup methods. The following backup methods need to be set
in ReaR with the +BACKUP=+ option.

DP::
    Use HP Data Protector to restore the data.

EXTERNAL::
    Internal backup method that uses an arbitrary external command to
    create a backup and restore the data.

GALAXY::
    Use CommVault Galaxy 5 to restore the data.

GALAXY7::
    Use CommVault Galaxy 7 to restore the data.

NBU::
    Use Symantec NetBackup to restore the data.

NETFS::
    Internal backup method which can be used to create a simple backup
    (tar archive).

REQUEST_RESTORE::
    *(default)* Not really a backup method at all, ReaR simply halts the
    recovery and requests that somebody will restore the data to the
    appropriate location (e.g. via SSH). This method works especially
    well with an rsync bases backup that is pushed back to the backup
    client.

RSYNC::
    Use rsync to restore data.

TSM::
    Use IBM Tivoli Storage Manager to restore the data. The ReaR result
    files (e.g. ISO image) are also saved into TSM.

If your favourite backup software is missing from this list, please submit
a patch or ask us to implement it for you.


== CONFIGURATION
To configure rear you have to edit the configuration files in _/etc/rear/_.
All _*.conf_ files there are part of the configuration, but only _site.conf_
and _local.conf_ are intended for the user configuration. All other
configuration files hold defaults for various distributions and should not
be changed.

In _/etc/rear/templates_ there are also some template files which are used
by rear to create configuration files (mostly for the boot environment).
Modify the templates to adjust the information contained in the emails
produced by ReaR. You can use these templates to prepend your own
configurations to the configuration files created by rear, for example you
can edit _PXE_pxelinux.cfg_ to add some general pxelinux configuration you use.

In almost all circumstances you have to configure two main settings and their
parameters: The backup method and the output method.

The backup method defines, how your data was saved and wether rear should
backup your data as part of the mkrescue process or wether you use an external
application, e.g. backup software to archive your data.

The output method defines how the rescue system is written to disk and how you
plan to boot the failed computer from the rescue system.

See the default configuration file _/usr/share/rear/default.conf_ for
an overview of the possible methods and their options.

An example to use TSM for backup and ISO for output would be to add
these lines to _/etc/rear/local.conf_:

    BACKUP=TSM
    OUTPUT=ISO

And if all your systems use NTP for time synchronisation, you can also
add these lines to _/etc/rear/site.conf_

    TIMESYNC=NTP

Don't forget to distribute the _site.conf_ to all your systems.

The resulting ISO image will be created in _/tmp_. You can now modify
the behaviour by copying the appropriate configuration variables from
_default.conf_ to _local.conf_ and changing them to suit your environment.


== EXIT STATUS
0::
    Successful program execution.
>0::
    Usage, syntax or execution errors. Check the _/tmp/rear-hostname.log_
    file for more information.


== EXAMPLES
To print out the current settings for +BACKUP+ and +OUTPUT+ methods and some
system information. This command can be used to see the supported features
for the given release and platform.

  # rear dump

To create a new rescue environment. Do not forget to copy the resulting
rescue system away so that you can use it in the case of a system failure.

  # rear mkrescue
