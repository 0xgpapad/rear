in "dr" we will analyse the system and start building the basic recovery
information such as disk partitioning files, LVM and Software Raid initiali-
zation scripts.
The scripts numbering convention for this phase is:
#00-#09	initialization
#10-#19	gather info of physical devices and write it into /etc/rear/recovery
#20-#29	gather the info of partitions (sfdisk/parted), and LVM
#30-#39	Software Raid
#40-#49	gather label and swap information
#50-#59	find Master Boot Record information
#60-#69
#70-#79
#80-#89	copy general configuration files of general interest (background info)
#90-#99	exit routines
