This is the "recreate" phase of rear (the recovery mode)
In this phase we format the disks, making partitions, software raid, lvm,
and creating file systems on top of it.
Finally, we mount all the necessary file systems needed for the restore phase

The phases numbering in use are:
#00-#09	initialization
#10-#19	make the partitions
#20-#29	create the Software Raid (if any)
#30-#39 create the LVM volume groups & lvols
#40-#49 make the file systems
#50-#59	make the e2labels (if any) & make the swap partitions
#60-#69	reserved
#70-#79 mount the file systems
#80-#89 reserved
#90-#99	exit routines

Do an 'ls -lR' to have a global overview in each phase as the numbering does matter
