#
# Each entry in this file is a line that contains a list of authentication
# methods followed by a colon followed by a list of host name or IP address
# patterns.
#
# Valid authentication method names can be found in the methods.txt file.
#
# The host name or IP address patterns can contain wild card characters.
#
# The keyword "ALL" can be used to signify all valid method names or
# all possible hosts.
#
# Empty lines are ignored.  The '#' character and all following characters
# on a line are ignored.
#
# This file is checked to determine if a given host cannot use a given
# authentication method.  This file is only checked if a matching entry
# for the method and host does not exist int the methods_allow.txt file.
# If an entry in this file (methods_deny.txt) matches the method and host,
# the method cannot be used.  If no match is found, the method can be used
# for the host.
#
# Examples:
#
# The vopie method cannot be used for hosts in the theircompany.com domain:
#
# vopie : .theircompany.com
#
# No methods can be used for hosts in the 123.123.56 network:
#
# ALL : 123.123.56.
#
# The default (ALL : ALL) is no methods can be used for any host.  This
# means that to be used, a method and host has to be explicitly defined in
# methods_allow.txt.
#
ALL : ALL
