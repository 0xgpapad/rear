#
# Each entry in this file is a line that contains a list of names
# followed by a colon followed by a list of host name or IP address
# patterns.
#
# The names are usually NetBackup client names.  This file is typically
# used when NetBackup clients are using DHCP or some other dynamic network
# addressing scheme where the network host name of the client may not
# be the same as the client name.
#
# The host name or IP address patterns can contain wild card characters.
#
# The keyword "ALL" can be used to signify all names or all possible hosts.
#
# Empty lines are ignored.  The '#' character and all following characters
# on a line are ignored.
#
# This file is checked to determine if a given host can use a given
# name.  If an entry in this file matches the name and host, the name can
# be used.  If not, the names_deny.txt file will be checked.
#
# Examples:
#
# The name "fred" can be used for all hosts dhcp0, dhcp1, and dhcp2 in the
# ourcompany.com domain:
#
# fred : dhcp0.ourcompany.com, dhcp1.ourcompany.com, dhcp2.ourcompany.com
#
# The name barney can be used for hosts in the 123.123.56 netork:
#
# barney : 123.123.56.
