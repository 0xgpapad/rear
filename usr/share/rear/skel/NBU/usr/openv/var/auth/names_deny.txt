#
# Each entry in this file is a line that contains a list of names
# followed by a colon followed by a list of host name or IP address
# patterns.
#
# The names are usually NetBackup client names.  This file is typically
# used when NetBackup clients are using DHCP or some other dynamic network
# addressing scheme where the network host name of the client may not
# be the same as the client name.
#
# The host name or IP address patterns can contain wild card characters.
#
# The keyword "ALL" can be used to signify all names or all possible hosts.
#
# Empty lines are ignored.  The '#' character and all following characters
# on a line are ignored.
#
# This file is checked to determine if a given host cannot use a given
# name.  This file is only checked if a matching entry for the name and
# host does not exist int the names_allow.txt file.  If an entry in this
# file (names_deny.txt) matches the name and host, the name cannot be used.
# If no match is found, the name can be used for the host.
#
# Examples:
#
# The name "fred" cannot be used for hosts in the theircompany.com domain:
#
# fred : .theircompany.com
#
# No names can be used for hosts in the 123.123.53 network:
#
# ALL : 123.123.56.
#
# The default (ALL : ALL) is no names can be used for any host.  This
# means that to be used, a name and host has to be explicitly defined in
# names_allow.txt.
#
ALL : ALL
